# WPF-Calculator
A clean and minimalistic calculator created to learn more about designing an WPF application. 

Back in early 2016 I created this calculator in order to get more knowledge about development in WPF. 
Also I wanted to try to make a minimalistic design of the usally very boring calculator.
